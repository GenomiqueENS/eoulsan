    <section name="How to compile Eoulsan">

	  <p>To build Eoulsan, you need a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">Java 2 Standard Edition SDK</a> greater or equals to 5.0 and <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> 2.2.x.</p>
	
	  <p>The next commands works whatever your operating system and the "<code>$</code>" character represent the command line prompt.</p> 
          <p>To compile Eoulsan, the default memory allocated by Maven is not enough. Your must set the environment variable <b>MAVEN_OPTS</b> to do this. To change this variable using bash use the built-in command <b>export</b> (512MiB or 1GiB is a good amount of memory of Maven):</p>
          <source>$ export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024m</source>	  
 
	  <p>First set your current directory to the base directory of <b>Eoulsan</b>.</p>
	  
	  <p>To build both source and binary distribution:</p>
	  <source>$ mvn install</source>
	  
	  <p>To generate documentation:</p>
	  <source>$ mvn site</source>
	  
	  <p>To generate distributions and documentation:</p>
	  <source>$ mvn site install</source>
	  
	  <p>To clean the build directories:</p>
	  <source>$ mvn clean</source>
