    <section name="Design file">

      <p>The design file is the main element of the pipeline. It contains all informations and descriptions of the experiment. It is a simple tabuled plain text file inspired by limma design file. Here is a sample of design file:</p>
      
<source>
SampleNumber	Name	FileName	Genome	Annotation	Condition	ReplicateType
1	s1	s1.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	c1	B
2	s2	s2.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	c2	B
3	s3	s3.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	c1	B
4	s4	s4.fq	mouse_build37.fasta	mouse_build37.gff	c2	B
</source>

	<p>In a design file 3 fields are mandatory:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>SampleNumber</b>: Numeric, must be unique and >0</li>
		<li><b>Name</b>: Name of the sample. Must be unique</li>
		<li><b>Filename</b>: Path to the reads data file. Can be an URL. The files must be in Fastq format and quality encoded in phred64. Next version of Eoulsan will be compatible with phred32.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>User can add any additional field in this file. Some of the optional field are currently used in Eoulsan:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Genome</b>: Path to genome file in fasta format</li>
		<li><b>Annotation</b>: Path to annotation file of the genome in GFF3 format</li>
		<li><b>Condition</b>: Condition for the sample in the experiement</li>
		<li><b>ReplicateType</b>: Type of replicate, two values are currently handled: "B" for biological replicate and "T" for technical replicate.</li>
		<li><b>UUID</b>: Universal Unique Identifier of the sample. This field is generated by Eouslan createdesign command. In obfuscated design files, this value does not change.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Compressed files in gzip (.gz) or bzip2 (.bz2) are handled by Eoulsan.</p>
