     <section name="Install an Hadoop cluster">

     <p>Eoulsan 2.x has been tested on an Hadoop cluster using Cloudera CDH 5.3 (Hadoop 2.5.0). As Eoulsan only requires Hadoop core modules, it can be deployed on any Hadoop 2.x cluster. Eoulsan requires the following Hadoop related software:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Hadoop HDFS and MapReduce (YARN)</li>
       <li>Zookeeper (Tested with Zookeeper 3.4.5)</li>
     </ul>

     <p>Eoulsan does not requires any particular Hadoop configuration change.</p>

     <p>To known how install the Cloudera CDH distribution, you can see the <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/documentation/core/v5-3-x/topics/introduction.html">Cloudera online Documentation</a>.</p>
