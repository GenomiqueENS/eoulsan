					<ul>
						<li><b>disp.est.method</b> : 
						There are three ways how the empirical dispersion can be computed:
						<ul>
							<li>
							<b>pooled</b> : Use the samples from all conditions with 
							replicates to estimate a single pooled empirical 
							dispersion value, called "pooled", and assign it 
							to all samples.
							</li>
							<li>
							<b>per-condition</b> : For each condition with replicates, 
							compute a gene’s empirical dispersion value by 
							considering the data from samples for this condition. 
							For samples of unreplicated conditions, the maximum
							of empirical dispersion values from the other 
							conditions is used.
							</li>
							<li>
							<b>blind</b> : 
							Ignore the sample labels and compute a gene’s 
							empirical dispersion value as if all samples were 
							replicates of a single condition. This can be done 
							even if there are no biological replicates. 
							This method can lead to loss of power; see the <a 
							href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/2.10/bioc/vignettes/DESeq/inst/doc/DESeq.pdf"
                                                        >DESeq vignette</a> for details. The single estimated dispersion 
							condition is called "blind" and used for all samples. 
							<u>If no replicate is available use this parameter</u>.
							</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>disp.est.sharing.mode</b> :
						After the empirical dispersion values have been computed
						for each gene, a dispersion-mean relationship is fitted
						for sharing information across genes in order to reduce
						variability of the dispersion estimates. After that, for
						each gene, we have two values: the empirical value 
						(derived only from this gene’s data), and the fitted
						value (i.e., the dispersion value typical for genes
						with an average expression similar to those of this gene)
						<ul>
							<li>
							<b>fit-only</b> : Use only the fitted value, i.e., 
							the empirical value is used only as input to the 
							fitting, and then ignored. Use this only with very 
							few replicates, and when you are not too concerned 
							about false positives from dispersion outliers, 
							i.e. genes with an unusually high variability.
							<u>If no replicate is available use this parameter</u>.
							</li>
							<li>
							<b>maximum</b> : take the maximum of the two values.
							This is the conservative or prudent choice, recommended
							once you have at least three or four replicates and
							maybe even with only two replicates.
							</li>
							<li>
							<b>gene-est-only</b> : No fitting or sharing, use 
							only the empirical value. This method is preferable 
							when the number of replicates is large and the 
							empirical dispersion values are sufficiently reliable.
							If the number of repli- cates is small, this option
							may lead to many cases where the dispersion of a
							gene is accidentally underestimated and a false
							positive arises in the subsequent testing.
							</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>disp.est.fit.type</b>
						<ul>
							<li>
							<b>parametric</b> : Fit a dispersion-mean relation
							of the form dispersion = asymptDisp + extraPois / 
							mean via a robust gamma-family GLM.
							</li>
							<li>
							<b>local</b> : Use the locfit package to fit a 
							dispersion-mean relation, as described in the DESeq
							paper.
							</li>
						</ul>

			<p>Eoulsan differential analysis module use R with the package DESeq
				as statistical
				backend. Differential analysis module was tested with
				R 2.15 and DESeq
				1.8.3 (Bioconductor 2.10).
				You need to install DESeq R packages on your
				computer or on a Rserve server:
			</p>

			<source>
$ sudo R
&gt; source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
&gt; biocLite("DESeq")

			<subsection name="Dispersion(variance) estimation">

				<div>
					Dispersion estimation is a critical step of differential
					analysis, a wrong estimation will not give reliable
					differential
					analysis
					results.
					DESeq perform a draft estimation and fit it with a
					local regression.
					The following graphs are plotted to control
					dispersion estimation
					"quality".
				</div>

				<h4>Double log graph</h4>

				<img src="images/dipersionEstimation.png" alt="" width="420" />

				<div>
					Normally the dispersion decrease when count value increase,
					that is why the black "cloud" (draft estimation values) and
					the red
					curve (fitted value) must be decreasing.
				</div>

				<h4>MA-plot</h4>

				<img src="images/MA-plot-mo_injection-mo_mirna_injection.png"
					alt="" width="420" />

				<div>
					The main DESeq assumption is that most of genes are NOT
					differentially expressed.
					It is possible to verify this assumption
					on this graph :
					most of points must be black and near to 0 on the
					vertical
					axis.
				</div>

				<h4>Raw p-value distribution barplot</h4>

				<img src="images/PvalueDistribution.png" alt="" width="420" />

				<div>
					If the differential analysis performed well, raw p-value
					except
					ends would be almost uniform.
				</div>

			<subsection name="Differential analysis">

				<h4>Differential analysis table</h4>

				<div>Differential analysis table contain 8 column :</div>
				<ul>
					<li>id : gene id extract from gff annotation file</li>
					<li>
						baseMean : mean of counts on data of the 2 condition
						compared
					</li>
					<li>
						baseMean_cond1 : mean of count on the first condition
						data
					</li>
					<li>
						baseMean_cond2 : mean of count on the second condition
						data
					</li>
					<li>
						FoldChange_cond2-cond1 : fold change
						baseMean_cond2/baseMean_cond1
					</li>
					<li>
						log2FoldChange\_cond2-cond1 : log2 of fold change
					</li>
					<li>
						pval : raw p-value
						(before Bejamini &amp; Hochberg correction)
					</li>
					<li>
						padj : adjusted p-value
						(after Bejamini &amp; Hochberg
						correction).
						This is the one to use.
